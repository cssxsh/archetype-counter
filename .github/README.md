# FAQ üìñ
### How does the Counter work?
> [OCR](https://www.ibm.com/blog/optical-character-recognition/) and several other utilities are used to scan screenshots of monster names and compares them against a list

> Monster nameplates processed using images passed through [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) formula by realmadrid1809 + additional logic cleanup in PowerShell

> Utilities scripted with PowerShell 5.1 by AnonymousPoke

&nbsp;

### Does the counter work on Linux, MacOS or mobile?
> Unfortunately no - the Counter utilizes built in WinForms in Powershell + Tesseract OCR & ImageMagick.

&nbsp;

### Does this work with custom PokeMMO client themes?
> Yes, it will work with all custom themes, but the monster nameplate text will be modified to be OCR compatible.

> Client theme.xml, font values and graphical assets (AC folder) are inserted into the currently installed theme list.

&nbsp;

### Does the Counter track Shiny Pok√©mon?
> Yes it does and it will also provide a prompt indicating a shiny is on the screen (Extra layer to prevent defeating or running from the shiny).

&nbsp;

### Does the Counter track Alpha Pok√©mon?
> Yes, but only as a total count in the counter - will not add to the normal tracked monster count.

&nbsp;

### Does the Counter track Legendary Pok√©mon?
> Yes.

&nbsp;

### How are Eggs and Fossils tracked?
> They are not tracked. You will need to manually set the count within the counter menu.

&nbsp;

### Does the counter track Zorua or Zoroark?
> Due to this Pok√©mon and it's ability.. No.

&nbsp;

### Can the Counter track 2 different Pok√©mon in a double wild battle or horde?
> Yes it does.

&nbsp;

### Can I convert data from other counters?
> Yes, but only the total encountered count.

> Manually editing profiles may cause corruption - located in `<Profile Name>\Config_<Profile Name>.txt`

&nbsp;

### When I go into battle, the counter does not count or go busy. What do I do?
> Jump on our discord so we can look to resolve the issue.

&nbsp;

### How do I fix incorrect scanned Pok√©mon names with the 'Name Fix' file?
> This should be done automatically via the counter when a scan fails and following the prompt. But, below is how to add manually.

> When a monster is incorrectly scanned via OCR, you take the 'failed' name and place it on the left hand side of the semi-colon and then take the correct monster name and place to the right of the semi-colon.

> `(Ex: Gastiy; Gastly)`

> You will need to restart the counter for these changes to take effect.

&nbsp;

### How do I manually remove additional characters/symbols from the failed scan?
> Open up the 'Name Fix' file from the counter menu and take the partial/incorrect text and place on the left hand side of the semi-colon and then place the word 'Blank' on the right hand side of the semi-colon

> `(Ex: GastE; Blank)`

> When a 'Blank' is provided on the right hand side of the semi-colon, this indicates the counter to completely remove that specific text - You will need to turn the counter OFF and then back ON for these changes to take effect

&nbsp;

### How can I report a bug?
> Before creating a report, review this readme and [the existing issues](https://github.com/ssjshields/archetype-counter/issues)

> Open the Debug folders from the Debug submenu, attach the `.png` and `.txt` file.
